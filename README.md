## Project Description

**MyHome** is a simple web application developed with the aim of tracking household cleanings. The main idea is to provide an intuitive tool to record who performed the last cleaning and to view the order of the next responsible individuals, following a weekly schedule among 6 people.

This project originated from the need to efficiently organise and monitor the household cleaning routine, ensuring everyone participates according to a predefined order.

## Current Features

* **Cleaning Registration:** Allows the user to record who performed the last house cleaning.
* **Next Cleaning View:** Displays who will be the next person responsible for cleaning, based on the established order.

## Technologies Used

* **Backend:** [Spring Boot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot)
* **Frontend (Initial):** [Thymeleaf](https://www.thymeleaf.org/)
* **Dependency Management:** [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/) 
* **Version Control:** [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
* **Code Hosting Platform:** [GitHub](https://github.com/) 
* **Application Hosting Platform:** [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/)

## Roadmap (Next Steps and Potential Future Features)

* **[Under Development]** Implementation of the basic logic for recording and viewing the cleaning order.

    * Reminders for the person responsible for the next cleaning.
